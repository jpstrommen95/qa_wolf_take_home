## To Done

- start exploring how `/news` actually is sorted
  - print exhaustive metadata
  - make a guess - maybe `score`?
  - make a new guess - maybe `id`?
- fix chronological checking logic
- simplify pagination by letting playwright just click the "more" button :facepalm:
- update pagination from /news query params to /newest query params
- fix url from /news to /newest :facepalm: (that would explain why they weren't sorted)
- print out metadata
  - parse timestamp
  - print titles
- refactor test
- complete question 1.2
  - exactly the first 100 articles are NOT sorted
- for reference, see how AI would solve this problem
- verify `node index.js` runs at least something
  - initial behavior seems to be opening up the specified hacker news
  - in ~my default~ [a chromium] incognito browser
  - doesn't seem to test anything yet (I sort of expected that)
- install playwright dependency locally
- Install dependencies
- Read and clean up readme
